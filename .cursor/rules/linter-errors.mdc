# Linter Error Handling Guidelines

## 1. Missing Component Errors

When you encounter an error such as:

```
Cannot find module '@/components/ui/button' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

- **If the component exists:**  
  The issue is likely due to path resolution. Do **not** manually change the import paths. Instead, simply restart your TypeScript server in your editor to resolve the error.

- **If the component is missing:**  
  Add it using the command below:

  ```bash
  pnpm ui add button
  ```

## 2. CSS Class Ordering Errors

If your linter highlights an error related to CSS class ordering, fix it by running the formatting tool:

```bash
pnpm fmt
```

This command automatically adjusts the CSS class ordering to meet the expected style.

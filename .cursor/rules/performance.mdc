# Next.js, React & UI Performance Guidelines

## Syntax and Formatting
- Use the `function` keyword for pure functions.
- Eliminate unnecessary curly braces in conditionals for a concise syntax.
- Write declarative JSX to improve readability and maintainability.

## UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind CSS for component styling.
- Follow a mobile-first approach when implementing responsive designs.
- To add Shadcn UI components, use the command:  
  `pnpm ui add [component]`

## Performance Optimization
- Favor React Server Components (RSC) by minimizing `use client`, `useEffect`, and `setState` where possible.
- Wrap non-critical client components in a `Suspense` component with an appropriate fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for components that are not part of the initial render.
- Optimize images by:
  - Using WebP format,
  - Including explicit size attributes,
  - Implementing lazy loading.

## Key Conventions
- Manage URL search parameter state with `nuqs`.
- Optimize for Web Vitals metrics such as LCP, CLS, and FID.
- Restrict usage of `use client` to small components that require web API access rather than for data fetching or state management.
